# Cross-Chain Token Swap DApp

## Overview

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to enable seamless cross-chain swaps of tokens. By leveraging advanced blockchain technology, this DApp facilitates the exchange of tokens across different blockchain networks, enhancing liquidity and accessibility for collectors and traders in the space.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Allows users to exchange NFTs between different blockchain networks, breaking down the barriers of isolated blockchain ecosystems.
- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Improves the liquidity of NFTs by enabling trades across multiple chains, providing more opportunities for buying, selling, and trading.
- **Accessibility**: Makes it easier for NFT collectors and traders to access a wider range of NFTs, regardless of the blockchain they were originally issued on.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Technology**: Utilized to ensure secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Implemented to handle the logic of NFT swaps between different chains.
- **Web3.js**: Used for interaction with the blockchain from the front-end.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language used for developing the contract logic.
- **Ethereum and Other Blockchains**: Supports Ethereum and other blockchain networks for cross-chain functionality.
